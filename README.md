# WikiGame
The Wiki Game is a hypertextual game designed to work specifically with Wikipedia. Objective is to start on the randomly selected article and navigate to another pre-selected target article but this Python script does searching instead of you and provides path from start to destination article.

The game is based of uninformed search algorithm *Breadth First Search*.

*Note: This script **does not** provide optimal or complete solution due to uninformed search and it can be stuck in loop for a long time without finding path from start to goal node*
